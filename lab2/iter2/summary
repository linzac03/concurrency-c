1)
run it

2)
i:1  process ID:9436 
            v
            v
i:2  process ID:9437
            v
            v
i:3  process ID:9438
            v
            v
i:4  process ID:9439

3)
Experiment with different numbers of processes, observe the processes adopted by init. what is the maximum amount of processes?
	most processes are adopted by init, I was unable to reach a maximum.

4)
Place sleep(10) before the fprintf. What is the maximum number of processes?
	I'm not sure I don't really want to test it since I'll have to 
	wait 10n quantums approximately to see the end result.
